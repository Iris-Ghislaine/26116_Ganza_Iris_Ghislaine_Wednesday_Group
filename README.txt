This submission demonstrates how to trigger and handle common Java exceptions through practical examples. Each exception is simulated deliberately with clear, commented code to showcase where and why the exception occurs. The provided handling mechanisms use try-catch blocks to manage the exceptions effectively. For exceptions that require clean-up or resource management, the finally block is included where appropriate.

Each exception is implemented in its own file for clarity, and comments are added to explain the purpose of each code block.
